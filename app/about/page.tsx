        I absolutely love the Genesis Creation Myth because it reveals so much
        about the origins of Judaism (and subsequently, Christianity). We see
        references to the Divine Council of gods, we see the two different
        accounts of creation (and the rise of the myth of Lilith to explain this
        difference). We see a belief in a fallible god (for it was not good that
        man was alone), but also the infallible god (for everything was very
        good). But most of all, it has the Garden of Eden.

        The Garden of Eden stands as a symbol of utopia, of everything being
        perfectly constructed and in its order. The whole goal of religion is to
        get us back to Eden. Everything is centered around this idea of getting
        back to a utopia or, maybe, something even better. The desire for most
        of the true believers of the varying sects that adhere to this mythology
        in some way is for a better tomorrow, since we came from a better
        yesterday.

        We curse Adam and Eve for their sin, we blame them for our current
        condition. Of course, the most learned among scholars will point out
        that we too sin. Some will say we inherit it via original sin, others
        will say we are totally depraved by nature, and others will say that our
        wills are not aligned with God, but all point to the Garden of Eden and
        our departure as the root of all our ills. After all, once Eve bit of
        the fruit she &quot;knew&quot; that they were naked, knew they were now
        mortal, knew right from wrong.

        For years I treated this story as literal. I was raised to believe that
        is the case. Thankfully, very early in my Christian education I found it
        was acceptable to take a more spiritual interpretation (after all, if
        it&apos;s good enough for Augustine, it&apos;s good enough for
        Protestants...sometimes). Yet, despite this I still had to believe in a
        literal fall at a point in space and time...hat tip to
        Schaeffer...otherwise it would mean God&apos;s creation was fallen from
        the beginning.{' '}

        I now view this story as a type of fan fiction of the
        Sumerian/Babylonean creation myth. But it has taken on personal
        signficance to me, because it is in the story of the Garden of Eden that
        I began to have questions. Even as a child, the story just didn&apos;t
        make sense to me. I have found, all these decades later, that I was
        never kicked out of Eden; I escaped it.{' '}

        It is this story that has inspired me to write my own creation
        mythology, not as a metaphysic, but as an existential treatise, as my
        views on life, as ramblings at times. I am still escaping Eden, all
        these years later, and in this wilderness I am making a creation of my
        own.

        I was raised a conservative Southern Baptist, and not just a &quot;we go
        here on Sunday&quot; Baptist, a &quot;This is our life&quot; Baptist.
        The entirety of my worldview, how I interpreted my experienced and all
        facts that came my way, was shaped by my understanding of theology and
        the Bible. As a child I was in Sunday School, as a youth I started
        reading works about apologetics, and finally in my early-20s I started
        an undergraduate degree in Christian Philosophy at a Southern Baptist
        seminary. Up until the age of 28, the Southern Baptist brand served as
        my brand of Christianity.

        My time at the seminary was fascinating and disappointing. On the one
        hand I was introduced to all these different thinkers &minus; Nietzsche, Kant,
        Hume, all the famous &quot;enemies of the faith&quot; &minus; on their own
        terms. On the other hand, I saw firsthand the effects of &quot;Christian
        love&quot; on people, I realized the logical conclusions of some of my
        beliefs, and I ultimately realized I had to decide between orthodoxy and
        love. I learned a lot academically, but I learned just as much through
        my experiences with the Baptists there to know I wanted nothing to do
        with it.

        I eventually fell in with the Orthodox Church and was even catechized.
        In the Orthodox Church &minus; my parish &minus; I found love and acceptance,
        openness, and a willingness to discuss things and question the faith.
        There was no rejection of science and there were quite a few Orthodox
        biologists, chemists, and so on. However, by this point the years of
        abuse within my Baptist upbringing and seeing it exist across multiple
        denominations on my journey, had left me cynical of any Christian
        church. While I loved my parish in North Carolina and the people there
        were genuine to me and loved me, I looked at other parishes and the
        overall views of the Orthodox Church and realized I no longer fit in.

        My views of homosexuality, transpeople, and many other social issues &minus;
        with exception to abortion &minus; had been shifting more toward a &quot;how could
        God view this as a sin&quot; mentality. If something didn&apos;t harm anyone then
        how was it violating &quot;God&apos;s Economy.&quot; While Dominionism teaches that
        Christians are to control the earth in all its glory (including the
        politics), it&apos;s just an extreme view of the common Christian belief in
        the “cultural mandate,” the belief that we&apos;re to be light and salt to a
        dark and rotten world. Thus, God has a natural order that we Christians
        are called to uphold and maintain, and part of that natural order
        involves human sexuality. But why would two men or two women loving each
        other violate God&apos;s economy? What about this is harmful? Things didn&apos;t
        make sense to me.

        Raised to believe that the Bible was the absolute authority over
        everything, once I began to remove it from the center of my worldview as
        the only source of authority, I began to open myself up to new ideas.
        This transition was essential in my transition to Orthodoxy &minus; after all,
        you can&apos;t believe in Sola Scriptura and be a good Orthodox. I had to
        open the door to Tradition and, by extension, reason.

        Yet, even within the Orthodox faith I saw the ugliness that I grew
        accustomed to in the SBC. The view of homosexuals, of those not of the
        faith, was shifting due to political grounds. I had studied philosophy
        and apologetics so intellectually I was very much a Christian, but
        existentially I was moving away from the faith entirely as I began to
        doubt it more and more.

        Throughout the years, thanks to Francis Schaeffer&apos;s thought guiding my
        own, I believed that certain aspects of the Bible had to be true in a
        very historical literal sense. The creation and fall of Adam and Eve was
        one example, otherwise how do we explain the existence of evil in this
        world and the need for God to save us? The death and resurrection of
        Christ, otherwise what hope was there for us in a literal physical
        resurrection? Thus, as I began to question my faith and shift toward
        Orthodoxy and even away from Orthodoxy, I already had a strong pretty
        bright line around what was a challenge to my faith and what wasn&apos;t.
        Finding out that the Bible was just wrong about certain things wasn&apos;t a
        challenge to my faith. Being unable to escape the evolution of humans as
        a species was a challenge to my faith due to how my faith had been
        constructed in such an absolute and rigid way.

        I am convinced that had I grown up under a less-rigid version of
        Christianity that I&apos;d probably still be a Christian or a theist of some
        type. I know quite a few Christians and theists who are great people and
        who&apos;s faith is foreign and alien to anything I would have recognized as
        a legitimate Christian faith when I was a Christian, but now I see as a
        completely reasonable way of shoring up their beliefs with what is known
        about reality. But I didn&apos;t grow up in that version of Christianity. I
        grew up in an extremely orthodox (within the American evangelical
        tradition) denomination with an extremely orthodox upbringing. My faith
        became all or nothing, to the point that it became nothing.

        Early in my Christian education I was introduced to the book Escape From
        Reason by Francis Schaeffer. The book lates the foundation for a
        conservative evangelical view of the world. In fact, it&apos;s difficult to
        be a respected conservative evangelical and not have been familiar with
        Schaeffer. If Schaeffer was escaping from “reason,” the word he used to
        describe the system of liberalism and neo-orthodoxy that had taken over
        the world, then I&apos;m escaping from Eden, the system of conservativism and
        orthodoxy that has taken over Christianity.

      <p className='w-full mx-auto text-md text-text1'>
        To escape from Eden is to escape the Biblical narrative of the creation,
        fall, and redemption of humanity and instead take the Bible and the
        world as it is. This blog is the aftermath of that escape. A lot of
        posts will deal with Christianity and faith, but some will just be about
        politics, economics, philosophy, culture, or any number of other issues.
        It&apos;s my attempt to rebuild my worldview and work through these issues
        once more, this time with a new perspective.

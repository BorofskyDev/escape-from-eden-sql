        At Escape From Eden, your privacy is our top priority. We collect
        minimal data—primarily to track site usage and improve your
        experience—and we will never sell or share your information with third
        parties. All subscriber data is used solely to keep you informed about
        new content, and to monitor how the site is used.

        Our subscriber list is kept completely confidential. We only use your
        email to send you updates on new posts, and any other communication is
        completely voluntary. We are an independent site, and all income is
        generated solely from voluntary contributions.

        user experience.
